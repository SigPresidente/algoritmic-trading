CS Graduation Project

This simple program uses official financial data from Yahoo Finance to elaborate a simple trading strategy based on the Moving Average Crossover method, and commands a demo account on Metatrader5 to buy/sell positions.
Data generated from the MT5 platform are then used to plot charts for study purposes.
